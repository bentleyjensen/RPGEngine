# RPGEngine

The purpose of the RPGEngine is to provide a framework for building RPGs. It does loads of stuff:

- A h*ck load of default items: potions, armor, weapons, furniture, vanity clothing and accessories, etc
- A h*ck load of default effects, which can be added to custom items, characters, and enchantments
- A h*ck load of deafult enemies, bosses, and NPCs
- Management for player experience and leveling up, with customization options for fine-tuning to your needs
- Map management, including optionally movement within an area with command line (Zork-like) and (some) GUI support
- Easy creation and management of NPCs, shops, enemies, bosses and spawning
- Static and dynamic dungeon generation
